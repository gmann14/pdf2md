# GIT CHEAT SHEET

Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub related that happens locally on your computer. This cheat sheet features the most important and commonly used Git commands for easy reference.

#### INSTALLATION & GUIS STAGE & SNAPSHOT

With platform specific installers for Git, GitHub also provides the Working with snapshots and the Git staging area ease of staying up-to-date with the latest releases of the command line tool while providing a graphical user interface for day-to-day git status interaction, review, and repository synchronization. show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit GitHub for Windows git add [file] h tt ps://windows.github.com add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage) GitHub for Mac h tt ps://mac.github.com git reset [file]

unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory For Linux and Solaris platforms, the latest release is available on the o ffi cial Git web site. git diff

Git for All Platforms di ff of what is changed but not staged h tt p://git-scm.com git diff --staged

di ff of what is staged but not yet commi tt ed

#### SETUP git commit -m “[descriptive message]”

Configuring user information used across all local repositories commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot

```
git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”
```

set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history

```
git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”
```

#### BRANCH & MERGE

Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes set an email address that will be associated with each history marker git branch git config --global color.ui auto

list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing git branch [branch-name]

create a new branch at the current commit

#### SETUP & INIT git checkout

Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory

```
git init git merge [branch]
```

initialize an existing directory as a Git repository merge the specified branch’s history into the current one

```
git clone [url] git log
```

retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL show all commits in the current branch’s history

#### INSPECT & COMPARE SHARE & UPDATE

Examining logs, di ff s and object information Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos

```
git log git remote add [alias] [url]
```

show the commit history for the currently active branch add a git URL as an alias

```
git log branchB..branchA git fetch [alias]
```

show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB fetch down all the branches from that Git remote

```
git log --follow [file] git merge [alias]/[branch]
```

show the commits that changed file, even across renames merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date

git diff branchB...branchA git push [alias] [branch]

show the di ff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch

```
git show [SHA] git pull
```

show any object in Git in human-readable format fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch

#### TRACKING PATH CHANGES REWRITE HISTORY

Versioning file removes and path changes Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history

```
git rm [file] git rebase [branch]
```

delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one

```
git mv [existing-path] [new-path] git reset --hard [commit]
```

change an existing file path and stage the move clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit

```
git log --stat -M
```

show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved TEMPORARY COMMITS

Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches

#### IGNORING PATTERNS git stash

Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of files Save modified and staged changes

logs/ git stash list *.notes pattern*/ list stack-order of stashed file changes

git stash pop Save a file with desired pa tt erns as .gitignore with either direct string matches or wildcard globs. write working from top of stash stack

```
git config --global core.excludesfile [file] git stash drop
```

system wide ignore pa tt ern for all local repositories discard the changes from top of stash stack
